# Notebook-DataSciencewithR  

This notebook presents an illustrative example of data analysis by using the Data
Science stack developed in Martín-Santana et al. (2019). In particular, the problem consists in studying
the hourly observations collected in meteorological stations located in the Canary
Islands (Spain) in order to obtain different statistical results using a Jupyter notebook
and several R libraries. These stations are included in the United States Air Force
(USAF) Master Station Catalog and registered in theNational Climatic Data Center’s
(NCDC) archive of weather and climate data.
